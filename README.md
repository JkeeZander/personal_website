Personal WEbsite for practicing APIs, and experimenting.

NOTES: 1)Give permission to webpage!:The website will get your location and send the weather infromation with the city to the website. YOu can see these details at the end of the website.

2)For now there is no styling for authentication and the profile is not accessible as hypertext reference, you can get there only by providing /profile url or logging in/registering.

Logout is also not accessible for now but will be provided soon!. I experimented with passport, sessions and did not style everything for now. SOon will be styled and added more functionality.(:

ALSO, for now all the password are visible in the database and the server side security is not done well.
